# UFOs

# Overview of Project: 

The purpose of this analysis is to provide Dana's webpage with an updated html website that contains more in depth UFO analysis allowing users to filter for multiple criteria.    In the results section I will be able to walk through the process in using the new search criteria. 

# Results: 

The updated html added table filters for the date, city, state, country and shape.   Adding this allows anyone that enters the site to be able to search these criterias.    

## HTML Pages and Search Results
Images below is a close up of all fields that can be entered to search:

To get to the images above, the person entering the site would scroll down from the home pages:

# Summary: 

## Drawbacks
Overall this first round of updates gives a clean overall look and appearance to a site that will be user-friendly.  The one drawback of this site is that there are limitations to the search criteria if the person searching doesn't have the specific date, city, state, country and shape.  Just like in many other search criteria's someone may have keywords or phrases.

## Additional Recommendations
- One recommondation to improve the site would be for the funtionallity and UX, creating drop down lists for the current values. 
- Second recommendation to improve the site would be to have information or contact information at the bottom (footer) of the site. Since there may be dates/areas that have information that may have not been documented it would be a way to have users interact and contact with this information.  It could also act as intake box for suggestion for the site, general inquiries and engaging.
